# EggDropperTDD
The egg dropper problem with the TDD software design methodology

## Description
Suppose that you had 100 eggs in a 100-floor skyscraper, and you wanted to conduct an experiment to find out the highest floor (criticalFloor) from which you could drop an egg without breaking it... but you’re also really hungry so you don’t want to waste any eggs.

## Levels
* **Basic difficulty**: Write a function, minEggDropper100, that will determine the minimum number of egg
drops (minDrops100) you’d need to find the criticalFloor.

* **Intermediate difficulty**: You’re at another 100-floor skyscraper and want to perform another experiment but this time you have only two eggs. Write a function, minEggDropper2, that will determine the minimum number of egg drops (minDrops2) you’d need to find the highest floor (criticalFloor2) from which you could drop an egg without breaking it.

* **Hard Difficulty**: Write minEggDropperX that will test for x many eggs and y many floors.
